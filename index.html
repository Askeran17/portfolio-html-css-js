                <br>
                <p>Programming has been an exciting journey for me, filled with challenges, creativity, and continuous
                    learning. I have experience working with multiple programming languages, including JavaScript,
                    Python, and C++. Each language has shaped my ability to develop efficient solutions and build
                    innovative projects.</p>

                <p>One of my key strengths is front-end development, where I create interactive and visually appealing
                    web applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React. I also enjoy working with
                    back-end technologies such as Node.js and databases like MySQL and MongoDB to develop full-stack
                    applications.</p>

                <p>Beyond coding, I am passionate about problem-solving, debugging, and optimizing performance. Whether
                    it's creating responsive websites, automating tasks, or developing algorithms, I always aim to write
                    clean and maintainable code. My programming journey is ongoing, and I am excited to keep learning,
                    improving, and building new projects!</p>

                <h3>Projects & Experience</h3>
                <p>Throughout my programming journey, I have worked on various projects, from dynamic web applications to automation scripts. One of my favorite projects involved developing a fully responsive portfolio website that showcases my work and technical skills.</p>
            
                <p>I also enjoy experimenting with algorithms and optimizing code efficiency. Recently, I built a machine learning model to analyze data trends, which helped improve decision-making processes.</p>
            
                <p>Collaboration is essential in tech, so I frequently engage in open-source contributions and teamwork. Working with other developers helps me grow my skills while contributing to meaningful projects.</p>
